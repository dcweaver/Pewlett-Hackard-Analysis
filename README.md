# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis.

## Project Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to perform a database analysis for the company Pewlett Hackard and extract detailed information about employees of the company who will be retiring or eligible for retirement in the near future. In addition to this, information on possible mentors for future hirees was collected, for the inevitable wave of new hires that will need assistance as they join the company.

## Results
* Shown below is an Entity Relationship Diagram, or ERD, used to help plan and visualize the relationships of the different tables of data in the database.

* When performing a count of the total number of employees approaching retirement eligibility, it became clear that the majority of employees are close to retirement age. As shown below, there are 29414 Senior Engineers and 28254 Senior Staff members for a total of 57,668 out of 90,398, or about 64% of total employees. This means that over half of the company is approaching retirement and the company is going to have to be ready to adjust.
